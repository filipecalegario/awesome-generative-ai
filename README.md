## Generative AI Processes and Artifacts

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/299057/226114498-c9b8a717-31e2-4630-b0ab-752b69005146.png" width=75% height=75%>

<summary>More info</summary>

**Generative AI** is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on creating new data based on patterns learned from existing data. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the process:

1. **Starting with Data**: Every Generative AI process begins with data. This can be in various forms such as text, images, sounds, or other datasets. This data serves as the foundational material that the AI uses to recognize and understand patterns.

2. **Training the AI**: With the data in hand, the next step is 'training'. During this phase, the AI processes the data multiple times to learn and internalize the patterns present. The outcome of this stage is a 'model', which acts like a digital representation of the knowledge derived from the data.

3. **Fine-Tuning**: At times, there's a need for the AI to focus on specific nuances or characteristics. In such cases, an additional set of data is used to 'fine-tune' the already trained model, enhancing its capabilities in the desired direction.

4. **Using the Model**: After training, the model is prepared to make inferences, which means using its acquired knowledge to process new data and come up with relevant outputs. This inference process can be executed locally on a machine or can be accessed remotely through an 'API'. The choice between local execution and API access often depends on factors like computational resources, application needs, and user preferences. Whether locally or via an API, the goal is to leverage the model's capabilities to derive meaningful results from new data inputs.

5. **Generating New Data**: With the model set up, the AI can now produce or 'generate' new data. By giving the AI certain 'input parameters' or guidelines, it returns with 'generated output', which is the newly created content.

6. **Applications**: The output generated by the AI can be incorporated into a range of applications, be it websites, mobile apps, or other digital platforms. The 'interface' refers to the user-facing portion of these applications, enabling users to interact with and benefit from the AI's capabilities.

In essence, Generative AI is about feeding an AI system vast amounts of data, training it to grasp underlying patterns, and then utilizing that trained knowledge to produce novel data. The potential applications and benefits of this technology are vast and continue to grow as the field evolves.
